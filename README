Our app is called interactive sticker wall.

You could create a sticker on the side, clicking the button “ADD Postit”. Then a sticker will pop out.

When you move your mouse to a sticker, you could select the background color of that sticker. We only offer 4 typical sticker colors, just like a real sticker you often use in life!

When you want to edit the text,  you could change text on the side window, or the pen icon under the sticker should be clicked.

And Deleting a sticker will be the trash icon.

Besides that, our sticker is interactive, which means if you open 2 or multiply browsers, you drag one of stickers on one of browsers, then that sticker on other broswers will move accordingly. Editing, deleting, or changing the sticker color will be sychronized.
